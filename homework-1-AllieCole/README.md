# Homework 1
## EDS 220, Fall 2021

This repo contains the instructions for your first homework assignment! Most of the steps should be familiar from our in-class exercises during Weeks 1 and 3, and additional template examples are provided in the companion Jupyter notebook for things we have not done together in class (e.g. time series calculations from GEE image collections).

You can work directly in the "HW1_template" notebook, or create a new one if you like, just let me know which one to look at!

Feel free to collaborate with each other, in the spirit of open-source data science: just remember that the work you ultimately hand in should be your own.

good luck and happy Pythoning!
